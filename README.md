# Laser-Security-Embedded-System

The issue of security is very important in any organization, especially in museum, banks. 
To protect the historical objects in museum, cash in banks, lockers, homes etc, we have design a laser security system that involves a laser light surrounded by the object and alarm or buzzer is connected.
Whenever an opaque thing is brought in between the laser light, huge sound is generated in buzzer. With this mechanism, one can be safe in protecting their objects in museum and in banks.
Here the main components of Laser security system are LDR and a basic alarm unit. 
These are easy to install and work at both within as well as outside houses.
